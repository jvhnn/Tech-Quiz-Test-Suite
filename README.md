# Project Description
The Tech Quiz Application is a full-stack quiz app designed to help users test their tech knowledge. Built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), it provides users with a set of randomly generated tech questions, displays their final score, and allows them to start a new quiz. The project highlights strong front-end interaction using React and robust back-end handling with MongoDB, making it a complete, interactive application for tech enthusiasts.

# User Story
As an aspiring developer,
I want to take a tech quiz
So that I can test my knowledge and improve my skills.

# Acceptance Criteria
Start the Quiz: When the user clicks the start button, the quiz begins, and the first question is displayed.
Answer Questions: The user answers each question and proceeds to the next one.
Display Score: When all questions are answered, the quiz ends, and the user’s score is displayed.
Restart Quiz: After viewing the score, the user can start a new quiz.

# Features
Randomized Questions: A set of random questions is fetched from a database each time the quiz starts.
Interactive UI: Users can answer questions and navigate through the quiz seamlessly.
Score Display: After completing the quiz, the application calculates and displays the score.
Data Persistence: The application uses MongoDB to manage and fetch questions.
Testing with Cypress: Component and end-to-end tests ensure application reliability.
